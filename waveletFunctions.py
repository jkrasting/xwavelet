# # WAVELET  1D Wavelet transform with optional significance testing
#   wave, period, scale, coi = wavelet(Y, dt, pad, dj, s0, J1, mother, param)
#
#   Computes the wavelet transform of the vector Y (length N),
#   with sampling rate DT.
#
#   By default, the Morlet wavelet (k0=6) is used.
#   The wavelet basis is normalized to have total energy=1 at all scales.
#
# INPUTS:
#
#    Y = the time series of length N.
#    DT = amount of time between each Y value, i.e. the sampling time.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#
#    WAVE is the WAVELET transform of Y. This is a complex array
#    of dimensions (N,J1+1). FLOAT(WAVE) gives the WAVELET amplitude,
#    ATAN(IMAGINARY(WAVE),FLOAT(WAVE) gives the WAVELET phase.
#    The WAVELET power spectrum is ABS(WAVE)**2.
#    Its units are sigma**2 (the time series variance).
#
# OPTIONAL INPUTS:
#
# *** Note *** if none of the optional variables is set up, then the program
#   uses default values of -1.
#
#    PAD = if set to 1 (default is 0), pad time series with enough zeroes to get
#         N up to the next higher power of 2. This prevents wraparound
#         from the end of the time series to the beginning, and also
#         speeds up the FFT's used to do the wavelet transform.
#         This will not eliminate all edge effects (see COI below).
#
#    DJ = the spacing between discrete scales. Default is 0.25.
#         A smaller # will give better scale resolution, but be slower to plot.
#
#    S0 = the smallest scale of the wavelet.  Default is 2*DT.
#
#    J1 = the # of scales minus one. Scales range from S0 up to S0*2**(J1*DJ),
#        to give a total of (J1+1) scales. Default is J1 = (LOG2(N DT/S0))/DJ.
#
#    MOTHER = the mother wavelet function.
#             The choices are 'MORLET', 'PAUL', or 'DOG'
#
#    PARAM = the mother wavelet parameter.
#            For 'MORLET' this is k0 (wavenumber), default is 6.
#            For 'PAUL' this is m (order), default is 4.
#            For 'DOG' this is m (m-th derivative), default is 2.
#
#
# OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
#
#    PERIOD = the vector of "Fourier" periods (in time units) that corresponds
#           to the SCALEs.
#
#    SCALE = the vector of scale indices, given by S0*2**(j*DJ), j=0...J1
#            where J1+1 is the total # of scales.
#
#    COI = if specified, then return the Cone-of-Influence, which is a vector
#        of N points that contains the maximum period of useful information
#        at that particular time.
#        Periods greater than this are subject to edge effects.

# WAVE_SIGNIF  Significance testing for the 1D Wavelet transform WAVELET
#
#   SIGNIF = wave_signif(Y,DT,SCALE,SIGTEST,LAG1,SIGLVL,DOF,MOTHER,PARAM)
#
# INPUTS:
#
#    Y = the time series, or, the VARIANCE of the time series.
#        (If this is a single number, it is assumed to be the variance...)
#    DT = amount of time between each Y value, i.e. the sampling time.
#    SCALE = the vector of scale indices, from previous call to WAVELET.
#
#
# OUTPUTS:
#
#    SIGNIF = significance levels as a function of SCALE
#    FFT_THEOR = output theoretical red-noise spectrum as fn of PERIOD
#
#
# OPTIONAL INPUTS:
#    SIGTEST = 0, 1, or 2.    If omitted, then assume 0.
#
#         If 0 (the default), then just do a regular chi-square test,
#             i.e. Eqn (18) from Torrence & Compo.
#         If 1, then do a "time-average" test, i.e. Eqn (23).
#             In this case, DOF should be set to NA, the number
#             of local wavelet spectra that were averaged together.
#             For the Global Wavelet Spectrum, this would be NA=N,
#             where N is the number of points in your time series.
#         If 2, then do a "scale-average" test, i.e. Eqns (25)-(28).
#             In this case, DOF should be set to a
#             two-element vector [S1,S2], which gives the scale
#             range that was averaged together.
#             e.g. if one scale-averaged scales between 2 and 8,
#             then DOF=[2,8].
#
#    LAG1 = LAG 1 Autocorrelation, used for SIGNIF levels. Default is 0.0
#
#    SIGLVL = significance level to use. Default is 0.95
#
#    DOF = degrees-of-freedom for signif test.
#         IF SIGTEST=0, then (automatically) DOF = 2 (or 1 for MOTHER='DOG')
#         IF SIGTEST=1, then DOF = NA, the number of times averaged together.
#         IF SIGTEST=2, then DOF = [S1,S2], the range of scales averaged.
#
#       Note: IF SIGTEST=1, then DOF can be a vector (same length as SCALEs),
#            in which case NA is assumed to vary with SCALE.
#            This allows one to average different numbers of times
#            together at different scales, or to take into account
#            things like the Cone of Influence.
#            See discussion following Eqn (23) in Torrence & Compo.
#
#    GWS = global wavelet spectrum, a vector of the same length as scale.
#          If input then this is used as the theoretical background spectrum,
#          rather than white or red noise.
