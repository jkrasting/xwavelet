Dear Dr. Torrence and Dr. Compo,

 

my name is Evgeniya and I am a PhD Student under the supevision of Prof. Georgiy Stenchikov at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).Â 

 

I am writing to say a great thank you for the wavelet paper and software you have provided on the website (http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/).Â I have found them very useful for my research! However, as I am mostly using Python, I have rewritten the code for Python environment. I have attached two Python files that contain all needed functions and the example, exactly as you have it for the other environments. I hope they can be somehow useful. Please let me know if you encounter any troubles running these codes.Â 

 

Thank you for your time and attention!

 

Sincerely,

Evgeniya Predybaylo
